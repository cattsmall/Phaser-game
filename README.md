Phaser Game Development
=============

Previously an experiment in FrozenJS, now a place to experiment with Phaser.

The branches ending in **template** contain a sample folder you can use to set up your game. You can download the folder using the button on the right and start making your own game! I'll try to keep that updated.

Want to see a game I made? Download the branches ending in **game**.

##Instructions
- Download ZIP, open ZIP
- Drag folder to Applications > XAMPP > xamppfiles > htdocs
- Open XAMPP/manager-osx, start servers
- Go to http://localhost/Phaser-game-master
